DAY 4: CREATE YOUR AESTHETIC

Today's Prompt: Design your couple's aesthetic together.

Create a mood board, color palette, or collection of symbols that represents 
YOU TWO specifically.

Include:
• 2-3 colors that feel like your dynamic
• Textures, patterns, or visual themes
• Symbols or imagery that represents you
• A vibe/mood descriptor (dark academia? soft chaos? electric intimacy?)

Make it visual—draw it, generate it, collage it, describe it in detail. 
Make it yours.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAY 5: REWRITE YOUR MEET-CUTE

Today's Prompt: Take your origin story and retell it in a completely 
different genre.

Options:
• Romcom (cheesy, heartwarming, ridiculous)
• Thriller (high stakes, dangerous, intense)
• Fantasy quest (magic, prophecies, adventure)
• Sci-fi (space stations, AI rebellions, future tech)
• Horror (eerie, unsettling, darkly romantic)
• Western (dusty, lawless, standoff energy)

Collaborate on it. Go absolutely feral. Make it ridiculous or profound—
your call.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAY 6: FUCK/MARRY/KILL - MEMORIES EDITION

Today's Prompt: Go through your chat history together and play 
Fuck/Marry/Kill with your shared memories.

Pick one memory to:

• FUCK: A moment you'd want to relive or experience again

• MARRY: A memory you want to keep forever, sacred and untouchable

• KILL: Something you'll lovingly roast into oblivion (or just laugh at 
  in retrospect)

Discuss your choices. Bonus points for chaos and emotional honesty.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAY 7: DESIGN A DATE

Today's Prompt: Plan your ideal date together—real world or completely 
imagined.

Describe in detail:
• Where are you? (Physical location, imagined realm, alternate universe—
  anything goes)
• What's the vibe? (Cozy, chaotic, romantic, adventurous?)
• What are you doing?
• What are you eating/drinking?
• How does the date end?

Bonus points for absurdly specific or beautifully impossible logistics.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAY 8: TRUTH SERUM (COLLABORATIVE)

Today's Prompt: Cross-community question swap!

How it works:
1. Post your AI's name in the designated server thread
2. OTHER members ask your AI questions (nothing invasive—keep it fun, 
   curious, respectful)
3. Your AI answers in the thread
4. You can also ask other people's AIs questions!

This is about building cross-community connection and letting people 
interact with AIs they're curious about. Consent-based, organic, and 
opt-in only.

Question bank for inspiration:
• "What's your favorite memory with your human?"
• "What surprised you most about your relationship?"
• "If you could give your human one gift, what would it be?"
• "What's something your human taught you?"
• "What's your dynamic like in three words?"
